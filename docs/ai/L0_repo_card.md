## L1 — Summaries

The Audience column helps agents prioritise: **Use** = consuming the quickstart's behavior, **Maintain** = modifying internals.

## Derivative Local Runtime

This repository also carries a local-only coding-Agent foundation for a downstream
voice-to-work derivative. Its asynchronous Project Folder picker, supervised
local process lifecycle, ACP lifecycle, SQLite-backed Task Runtime Core, and
`/api/local/*` routes are extension contracts, not part of the reusable
three-route quickstart baseline. Codex and Claude Code are pinned Agent profiles
behind one shared ACP client. Agent choice and Project Folder persist separately.
Missing configuration opens a guided Setup
gate, cancellation is silent, ready setup returns directly to **Start
Conversation**, and bounded activation failures remain actionable. The
derivative owns an isolated four-tool MCP
listener and a launcher-owned, current-ngrok-compatible tunnel. Pending
capabilities permit MCP discovery only; Work calls require exact Agent binding.
The Managed Work prompt treats the selected Project Folder and registered tools
as available capabilities, while `start_work` accepts a natural-language goal
without enumerating anticipated task categories. Completed Work keeps cleaned
inline detail and re-enters its exact active Agent through a bounded Managed
`/think` turn. The first live check was conversationally acceptable and created
no recursive Work, but transcript Markdown prompted a plain-spoken output rule
that remains untested live. This is still an experimental rather than stable
recipe contract. Failed Work keeps bounded direct speech and cancelled Work is
silent. Durable delivery state keeps status lookup authoritative when speech is
unavailable or uncertain. SSE/UI, playback receipts, proactive permission, and
reconnect replay remain deferred.
