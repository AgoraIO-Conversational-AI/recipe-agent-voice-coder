# 02 Architecture

> Split frontend + backend in one repo: Next.js browser app proxies `/api/*` to a Python FastAPI service that drives the Agora Conversational AI managed agent.

```

## Voice Session Lifecycle

1. `LandingPage` calls `getConfig()` → `GET /api/get_config` → FastAPI returns `data: { app_id, token, uid, channel_name, agent_uid }`.
2. In parallel:
   - `startAgent(channel_name, Number(agent_uid), Number(uid))` → `POST /api/startAgent` → FastAPI starts the managed agent.
   - `new AgoraRTM.RTM(appId, uid).login({ token })` → `subscribe(channel_name)`.
3. `ConversationComponent` mounts inside a dynamic `AgoraRTCProvider` (RTC client in `useRef` for StrictMode safety) and:
   - `useJoin` joins RTC.
   - `useLocalMicrophoneTrack` + `usePublish` start mic publishing.
   - `AgoraVoiceAI.init({ rtcEngine, rtmConfig: { rtmEngine: rtmClient } })` wires transcripts, state, metrics.
   - `subscribeMessage(channel_name)` opens the toolkit's RTM channel.
4. End: `stopAgent(agentId)` → `POST /api/stopAgent` → FastAPI stops the agent. `rtmClient.logout()` follows.
5. Renewal: on RTC `token-privilege-will-expire`, the client fetches `getConfig()` twice (once for RTC uid, once for the stored `agoraData.uid`) and renews RTC + RTM separately.

## How `/api/*` Reaches FastAPI

`web/next.config.ts`:

```ts
async rewrites() {
  const backendUrl = process.env.AGENT_BACKEND_URL?.replace(/\/$/, '');
  if (!backendUrl) return [];
  return [
    { source: '/api/get_config',  destination: `${backendUrl}/get_config` },
    { source: '/api/startAgent',  destination: `${backendUrl}/startAgent` },
    { source: '/api/stopAgent',   destination: `${backendUrl}/stopAgent` },
  ];
}
```

If `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` is unset/empty, **no rewrites register** — the client cannot reach the backend. `bun run dev` always exports `AGENT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000` before starting Next.

The derivative `/api/local/*` rewrites have a stricter gate: the launcher must
set `VOICE_ACP_LOCAL_RUNTIME=1`, `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` must name a loopback host,
and `NODE_ENV` must not be `production`. Normal and public Next deployments do
not publish the local filesystem/runtime facade.

## FastAPI Shape

`server/src/server.py`:

- `FastAPI(title="...", version="2.0.0")`.
- `CORSMiddleware` with `allow_origins=["*"]`, `allow_credentials=True`.
- Reads `server/.env.local` then `server/.env` via `python-dotenv` at startup, resolved relative to `server/src/server.py`.
- Constructs a single `Agent` instance at import time (`agent = Agent()`).
- Routes registered on an `APIRouter`: `GET /get_config`, `POST /startAgent`, `POST /stopAgent`.
- All responses use the envelope `{ "code": 0, "msg": "success", "data": ... }`.
- Errors funnel through `_to_http_error` → `HTTPException` (`ValueError → 400`, `RuntimeError → 500`, else `500`).
- `uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=PORT)` under `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

`server/src/agent.py`:

- `get_config` treats missing, zero, and negative UIDs as "generate a usable UID" before minting an RTC+RTM token.
- `Agent.start(channel_name, rtc_uid, user_uid)` uses the module-level `AsyncAgora` client, builds `AgoraAgent` from `agora-agents` (`agora_agent`), and creates an async session.
- `Agent.stop(agent_id)` ends the session.

## Managed Agent Defaults (server/src/agent.py)

| Stage | Vendor       | Config highlights                                                          |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STT   | `DeepgramSTT`| `model="nova-3"`, `language="en"`                                           |
| LLM   | `OpenAI`     | `model="gpt-4o-mini"`, greeting/failure overrides, history settings        |
| TTS   | `MiniMaxTTS` | `model="speech_2_6_turbo"`, `voice_id="English_captivating_female1"`        |
| VAD   | Agora        | Tunable `turn_detection` dict with start/end mode and timing thresholds    |

Agent parameters: `data_channel="rtm"`, `enable_error_message=True`, `enable_metrics=True`. Advanced features: `{"enable_rtm": True, "enable_tools": True}`. Session options: `enable_string_uid=False`, `idle_timeout=30`, `expires_in=3600`.

## Why This Shape

- Python backend gives Python developers a familiar host for Conversational AI integration.
- Next.js rewrites hide backend placement from the browser — `/api/*` is the only URL the client knows.
- Single repo keeps web and backend changes reviewable together while preserving deploy separation.

## Derivative Local Codex Runtime

The local Codex foundation adds a separate loopback-only path without changing
the quickstart conversation routes:

```text
Project Folder Settings gate -> /api/local/* -> /local/* -> WorkspaceService
  -> LocalRuntimeCoordinator -> CodexAcpClient child process -> ACP session
  -> TaskRuntime -> SQLite WorkStore -> one FIFO ACP prompt worker
Managed Voice LLM -> ngrok HTTPS -> authenticated /mcp/
  -> ManagedWorkTools -> TaskRuntime -> ACP session
```

`WorkspaceService` persists one resolved primary directory. It is ACP context,
not a filesystem sandbox. `LocalRuntimeCoordinator` returns only safe
readiness states and serializes one active session; it closes an old session
before opening a replacement. Ordinary FastAPI lifespan startup only owns
cleanup; it never starts ACP. The local page explicitly activates saved state
through `POST /api/local/runtime`, while the GET is read-only.

`CodexAcpClient` uses the pinned `npx` command, tries session creation with
reusable credentials first, performs advertised ChatGPT auth only after typed
authentication-required, and retries once with `mcp_servers=[]`. Advanced
child pass-through and JSON-argv custom commands remain in agent mode and do
not expose command environments. Offline tests replace this boundary with fake
clients/processes.

The opted-in local app also owns `TaskRuntime`. It durably accepts
Workspace-scoped Work before execution, runs one ACP prompt at a time, stores
only safe activity and bounded results, brokers one current-operation
permission, confirms cancellation, and recovers interrupted Work as failed on
restart. It starts and stops with the local FastAPI lifespan. The browser has
no Work route. Instead, an isolated public ASGI listener exposes exactly four
authenticated MCP tools: `start_work`, `get_work_status`, `cancel_work`, and
`respond_permission`.

`ManagedIngressCoordinator` starts that listener and ngrok lazily during Agent
preparation, then activates the capability only after Agora returns the real
`agent_id`. Capabilities are bound to the current Workspace generation and
Agent, kept only in memory, and revoked before Agent/tunnel shutdown. A tunnel
URL change requires an Agent restart because the endpoint is part of the Agent
configuration.

The `/think` completion flow is implemented as an experimental prototype and
is not a stable contract until its separately authorized live acceptance
passes. `WorkDeliveryCoordinator` receives only terminal Work IDs after Task Runtime
commits completed or failed state. Each receipt privately retains its
originating Agent ID. Completed Work stores a cleaned full inline result and a
fixed direct-speech fallback. The coordinator revalidates the exact
Work-capable session and Workspace, atomically claims `pending_delivery`, builds
an at-most-8-KiB `LOCAL_WORK_COMPLETED` JSON envelope, and calls
`AgentSession.think` with listening `inject`, thinking/speaking `interrupt`, and
`interruptable=True`. Normal return means only injected-input `accepted`.
A definite HTTP rejection may use one APPEND fallback; an ambiguous exception
is `delivery_unknown`, is never retried, and cannot fall back. Failed Work uses
its bounded safe APPEND error, cancelled Work is silent, and no session or a
changed Workspace leaves the result pending for status lookup.

Agora can send MCP `initialize` and tool discovery before Agent creation
returns. The prepared bearer therefore has a pending phase that admits only
`initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, `tools/list`, and `ping`. Tool calls
remain closed with a retriable `503` until the real `agent_id` activates the
binding; invalid and revoked bearers remain `401`.

## Validation-only public boundary

The Managed Voice LLM evidence harness constructs a second ASGI app at `server/src/architecture_validation/public_server.py`. The live runner serves it on a separate loopback port and exposes only that port through ngrok. It contains authenticated Streamable HTTP MCP only. Local lifecycle and seed routes remain on the original FastAPI surface and are never mounted into the public app.

Both ASGI apps must run in one process because validation capabilities and
synthetic state are deliberately in memory. This validation boundary remains a
separate synthetic harness; it does not invoke the production Task Runtime.
