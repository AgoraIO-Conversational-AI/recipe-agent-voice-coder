# 05 Workflows

> Step-by-step recipes for the tasks contributors actually do in this repo.

## Add a New Backend Endpoint

1. Add a route in `server/src/server.py` (`@router.get("/path")` or `@router.post(...)`).
2. Implement the handler `async def`. Use existing pydantic models or add a new one. Validate via FastAPI's automatic validation; for cross-field rules, raise `HTTPException` directly.
3. If the endpoint needs new service logic, add a method to `Agent` in `server/src/agent.py`.
4. Add the corresponding rewrite in `web/next.config.ts`:
   ```ts
   { source: '/api/<name>', destination: `${backendUrl}/<name>` }
   ```
5. Add a fetch helper in `web/src/services/api.ts`.
6. Extend `web/scripts/verify-api-contracts.ts` with at least one happy-path and one validation case.
7. Run `bun run verify:backend && bun run verify:web:api`. Extend `verify-local-proxy.ts` / `verify-local-fastapi.ts` if the route belongs in the smoke flow.

## Change Agent Prompt, VAD, Model, or Voice

Edit `server/src/agent.py`:

- **Prompt:** modify the `ADA_PROMPT` constant.
- **Greeting:** set `AGENT_GREETING` in `server/.env.local`, or change the default in the constructor.
- **VAD:** edit `turn_detection` dict (start/end mode, speech threshold, silence/interrupt durations).
- **LLM:** change the `OpenAI(...)` constructor (model, history, BYOK key, base URL).
- **STT:** change the `DeepgramSTT(...)` constructor.
- **TTS:** change the `MiniMaxTTS(...)` constructor (`model`, `voice_id`).
- **Agent parameters:** edit `AgoraAgent(parameters=...)` and `advanced_features` for server-side RTM data channel, error messages, metrics, and tool flags.
- **Session:** edit `create_async_session(...)` parameters (`idle_timeout`, `expires_in`, `enable_string_uid`).

After editing, run `bun run verify:backend && bun run verify:web:api`.

## Maintain the Inherited Deployable Quickstart Path

The shipped Voice Coder experience is local-only because it depends on a local
Project Folder, ACP child process, and Agent-native authentication. The
following split deployment remains upstream-maintenance context for the
inherited generic quickstart path; it is not the Voice Coder product journey.

- **Web (Next.js):** build via `cd web && bun run build`. Configure `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` on the deploy target to the public URL of your FastAPI service. Serve with `bun run start` or any Node hosting platform.
- **Backend (FastAPI):** install deps from `server/requirements.txt`, set `AGORA_APP_ID`, `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`, optional `AGENT_GREETING`/`HOST`/`PORT`, and run `python3 server/src/server.py` or `uvicorn server.src.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`.
- The two deploys never share env vars. The browser only ever needs `/api/*` to resolve via the rewrite layer.

## Verify Locally

```bash
bun run doctor              # quick gate
bun run doctor:local        # adds python3 + env checks
bun run verify:backend      # Python compile + all offline backend suites
bun run verify:web:api      # contract harness on the rewrite shape
bun run verify:web:proxy    # static fake-server smoke
bun run verify:local:fastapi # spawns FakeAgent inside FastAPI
bun run verify:web:build    # production build
bun run verify              # alias for production-bound web checks
bun run verify:local        # full chain including backend + fastapi + proxy + build
```

## Run the Inherited `bun run dev` Path

```bash
bun run dev
# concurrently {
#   dev:backend  → python3 server/src/server.py
#   dev:frontend → cd web && AGENT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000 bun run dev
# }
```

`concurrently` propagates Ctrl-C to both processes. If one crashes, both exit.

## Run Agora Voice Coder

```bash
bun run dev:codex
```

The app loads Project Folder status first. While status is unknown, the pre-call
action reads **Checking local setup…** and is disabled. Without a valid saved
directory, Settings opens automatically and conversation start is blocked
without creating an error. Select with the backend-owned native macOS picker or
the advanced manual path. The native modal contains keyboard focus, and a
synchronous web guard prevents repeated clicks from starting concurrent picker
operations. Cancelling the picker returns silently to Settings; a successful
selection activates ACP, closes Settings, and focuses **Start
Conversation** without another click. Bounded activation failures stay in
Settings with **Try Again**. Do not describe the folder as a sandbox. A failed
replacement restores the previous persisted selection.

Use `GET /api/local/runtime` only to display readiness; it must not start ACP.
For a valid saved Workspace, the local page uses `POST /api/local/runtime` to
activate ACP explicitly after ordinary FastAPI startup completes. Normal/public
Next deployments do not register `/api/local/*` rewrites.

The opted-in local FastAPI lifespan starts the Task Runtime, marks interrupted
nonterminal Work failed, and stops it before ACP and SQLite shutdown. After ACP
is ready, **Start conversation** prepares the isolated four-tool MCP listener,
starts ngrok, and binds one capability to the Agora Agent. Completed and failed
The following completion path is an experimental prototype pending required
live acceptance, not a stable recipe contract. Work completion is submitted
once to the exact originating active Agent through
a bounded `LOCAL_WORK_COMPLETED` Managed `/think` turn. Listening uses `inject`;
thinking and speaking use `interrupt`; the produced speech remains
interruptible. API acceptance is persisted but is not generated-text or
playback proof. A definite HTTP rejection may use one fixed APPEND fallback;
an ambiguous result is never retried or followed by speech. Failed Work keeps
bounded APPEND speech and cancelled Work remains silent. If the session is gone
or the Workspace changed, `get_work_status` remains authoritative. Activity
Panel, playback receipts, automatic replay, and proactive permission speech are
not part of this milestone.

Offline verification uses fake sessions and consumes no Agora minutes. A live
completion-quality check must be separately authorized and should use one
session to observe conversational quality, interruption recovery, transcript
visibility of synthetic input, and recursive tool behavior.

The launcher preflight validates macOS Apple Silicon, Bun/Node/Python/ngrok, and
usable Agora configuration without printing secrets. Advanced examples:

```bash
bun run dev:codex -- --workspace /absolute/project/path
CODEX_PATH=/absolute/path/to/codex bun run dev:codex
bun run dev:codex -- --acp-command-json '["custom-acp","--stdio"]'
```

`CODEX_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` may be passed to the child as advanced
authentication inputs. None of these paths bypasses Workspace validation or
changes `INITIAL_AGENT_MODE=agent`.

The real `npx` package execution, ChatGPT browser authentication, native picker,
Agora conversation, and public ngrok reachability remain manual/live checks.

## Token Renewal

The browser receives `token-privilege-will-expire` from RTC and calls `getConfig()` twice — once with the RTC `client.uid`, once with the stored `agoraData.uid`. The Python backend re-issues RTM-capable RTC tokens via `generate_convo_ai_token`. If a request passes `uid=0`, the backend generates a non-zero UID because Agora RTC treats `0` as auto-assign but RTM token subjects cannot use `0`.

## Update Module Guides After Behavior Changes

If you change runtime behavior, also update:

- `README.md`
- Repo-root `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- The relevant file in `docs/ai/L1/` (often `02_architecture.md` and `03_code_map.md`) and `Last Reviewed` in `docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md`

## Implement a Baseline Recipe Repo

1. Treat this repo as the Python-backed Agora quickstart baseline.
2. Do not recreate Agora ConvoAI integration from memory.
3. Follow [from_scratch_bootstrap.md](L2/from_scratch_bootstrap.md) for the implementation map and checklist.
4. Preserve the recipe invariants in `docs/ai/RECIPE.md`.
5. Run the verification commands before publishing a derivative.

## Roll Back the Inherited Deployable Path

- **Web:** redeploy the previous Next build on the host platform.
- **Backend:** redeploy the previous Python source tarball or container. FastAPI is a single-process service — restart with the older artifact.
