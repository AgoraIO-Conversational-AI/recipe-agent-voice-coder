> Concrete pitfalls that have been hit before. Read this before refactoring across the proxy boundary.

## `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` Is Mandatory for the Web Client

`web/next.config.ts` only registers `/api/*` rewrites when `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` is set, after removing one trailing slash. If it is unset:

- `web/scripts/doctor.ts` exits with an error.
- `bun run dev` for the web alone returns 404 on every `/api/*` call.
- The browser surfaces "failed to start agent" with no obvious cause.

`bun run dev` always exports `AGENT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000`. Deploy hosts must set it manually.

## Project Folder Is Not a Sandbox

The local Codex Project Folder is a persisted ACP Workspace Scope and context
for one session. It does not restrict child-process filesystem access. The
default state file is `~/Library/Application Support/Agora Voice ACP/workspace.json`;
`VOICE_ACP_STATE_DIR` changes only the parent state directory.

## Picker Success Includes ACP Activation

The asynchronous picker does not report `ready` immediately after the macOS
dialog returns. Its selection first passes Workspace validation and local ACP
activation. Native cancellation is a normal terminal state and must not be
rendered as an error. Activation failure must preserve the existing bounded
runtime or switch-guard reason; collapsing it to **Could not select the Project
Folder** sends the user to the wrong recovery action.

## Offline ACP Coverage Is Not Live Acceptance

Fake ACP tests prove the client boundary, readiness serialization, loopback
routes, and safe failure states. They do not prove a real `npx` download or
Codex launch, ChatGPT browser authentication, macOS picker behavior, Agora
conversation start, or ngrok. Treat each as an authorized manual/live check.

## ACP Ready Does Not Mean the Agent Ingress Is Ready

`LocalRuntimeStatus.state == "ready"` proves only that one ACP session is open.
The MCP listener, ngrok tunnel, and capability are prepared when the user
starts the Agora conversation. If the tunnel URL changes, the Agent must be
restarted because its MCP endpoint cannot be updated in place. Completed
targeted Work is injected into the exact original active Agent with
`AgentSession.think`. `/think` has no APPEND action: listening supports
`inject`, while thinking/speaking use intentional `interrupt`. Its normal
response contains no generated answer or playback receipt, so `accepted` proves
only input acceptance. The synthetic input may also appear as a user-role item
in history or transcript; do not hide it by matching the marker text alone.
Missing sessions stay `pending_delivery`; ambiguous submission becomes
`delivery_unknown`, cannot fall back, and is not replayed. Failed Work keeps
bounded APPEND speech. `get_work_status` remains the authoritative fallback.

## Local Runtime Overrides Are Explicit and Narrow

The default remains the pinned `npx` argv with `INITIAL_AGENT_MODE=agent`.
`CODEX_PATH`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` pass only to the child.
Custom ACP commands use `VOICE_ACP_COMMAND_JSON` as a JSON argv array, never a
shell string. Do not log any child environment or auto-select full access.

`--workspace` is converted to `VOICE_ACP_WORKSPACE` by the launcher, then uses
the same absolute, existing-directory validation and persistence path as
Settings. Ordinary FastAPI startup does not activate ACP; the local page uses
the explicit runtime POST after loading saved state.

## Local Rewrites Are Not Deployment Routes

`AGENT_BACKEND_URL` alone registers only the three stable quickstart rewrites.
`/api/local/*` additionally requires the local opt-in, a loopback backend URL,
and a non-production Next process. Do not set the opt-in on a public deployment.

## No `web/app/api/**/route.ts`

`web/scripts/verify-api-contracts.ts` asserts that no `app/api` route handlers exist. The web client must be rewrite-only. Adding a Next route handler would:

- Shadow the rewrite path (Next matches local routes before applying rewrites).
- Diverge behavior between local dev and deployed environments.
- Fail `bun run verify:web:api` immediately.

## Doc / Code Drift

- Per-module `AGENTS.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` under `web/` and `server/` were removed. Use repo-root `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/ai/L1/` as the maintained entry points.
- When reconciling older notes with the code, watch for: no `useAgoraConnection` hook (lifecycle is inline in `LandingPage.tsx` / `ConversationComponent.tsx`), Turbopack mentions vs `web/package.json` using `next dev --webpack`, and FastAPI session APIs (`create_async_session`, error mapping via `_to_http_error`) vs outdated snippets.

Until stale copies reappear elsewhere, prefer code + `docs/ai/` as the source of truth.

## StrictMode + RTC

- `web/next.config.ts` sets `reactStrictMode: true`. RTC client creation must stay inside the dynamically imported `AgoraRTCProvider` with a `useRef`-held instance.
- `useJoin`, `useLocalMicrophoneTrack`, `usePublish` own their lifecycles; do not call `.leave()`, `.close()`, or `unpublish` manually.

## `uid="0"` Sentinel

`normalizeTranscript` in `web/src/lib/conversation.ts` maps `uid === '0'` to the local UID before rendering. New transcript renderers must use the normalized turn list — bypassing the helper puts the user on the wrong side.

## Token Renewal Uses Two `getConfig` Calls

`handleTokenWillExpire` in `LandingPage.tsx` issues two `getConfig()` requests:

- One with the RTC `client.uid` for the RTC renewal.
- One with the stored `agoraData.uid` for the RTM renewal.

`ConversationComponent` skips renewal entirely if `joinedUID` is `0`. If you change UID handling, walk this path end-to-end before merging.

## One Token String, Concrete UID

The quickstart deliberately uses `generate_convo_ai_token` for both RTC and RTM to keep setup simple. That only works after FastAPI has resolved a concrete user UID. Do not pass `0` through to RTM login or RTM renewal.

## FastAPI Agent Is a Module-Level Singleton (and Holds Sessions)

`server.py` runs `agent = Agent()` at import time. Every request reuses the same instance. Important consequences:

- `Agent.__init__` is the only place env vars are read. If `AGORA_APP_ID` is missing at import and the constructor raises, `agent` stays `None` and route handlers return `500`.
- `Agent._sessions: Dict[str, Any]` holds active sessions keyed by `agent_id` across requests. `Agent.start` writes; `Agent.stop` pops. Treat `_sessions` as the source of truth for live sessions on this worker.
- Per-request data (validated body, query params) lives in pydantic models or local variables. Do not stash arbitrary request state on `Agent` — only cross-call session bookkeeping belongs there.
- Reloading via `uvicorn --reload` re-runs `Agent()`. In production, the singleton lives for the life of the worker, so a process restart resets `_sessions`.

## CORS Is Wide Open

`server/src/server.py` uses `CORSMiddleware(allow_origins=["*"], allow_credentials=True)`. This is fine for a local quickstart but is **not** appropriate for production. Tighten this before exposing the FastAPI service publicly.

## Env Loading Is File-Relative

`server.py` derives the `server/` directory from `__file__` and loads `server/.env.local` then `server/.env`. Running from the repo root still finds those files; missing `AGORA_APP_ID` or `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` leaves `agent = None` and routes return `500`.

## `server/scripts/run_fake_server.py` Is for Tests Only

The fake server replaces `Agent` with `FakeAgent` and is started by `verify:local:fastapi`. Do not deploy it — it skips all real Agora calls and accepts any input.

## Server-Side Agent Flags

RTM delivery, tool enablement, metrics, error messages, and data channel settings belong in `server/src/agent.py`. The browser only consumes the resulting events; it should not invent server-side agent parameters.

## No `Co-Authored-By` in Commit Messages

The repo's git history is human-authored. Keep it that way — see `AGENTS.md` "Git Conventions."
