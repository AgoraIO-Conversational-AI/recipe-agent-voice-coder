# 08 Security

> Trust boundaries, secret handling, and security-relevant invariants for the two-process Python quickstart.

## Trust Model

- The browser is untrusted. It may only see Agora tokens issued by the FastAPI server.
- The FastAPI server is the only process that holds `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` and any future BYOK keys.
- The Next.js process sees `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` (a server-side build env var) but does not see any Agora secret.
- The FastAPI server has no per-user authentication today; the threat model assumes the backend URL is gated upstream.

## Environment Variable Boundaries

| Boundary       | Variables                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser        | `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_UID` (optional)                                     |
| Next build/run | `AGENT_BACKEND_URL`                                                    |
| FastAPI        | `AGORA_APP_ID`, `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`, `AGENT_GREETING`, `HOST`, `PORT` |
| Local launcher | `VOICE_ACP_LOCAL_RUNTIME`, `VOICE_ACP_WORKSPACE`, `VOICE_ACP_COMMAND_JSON` |
| ACP child      | trimmed inherited env plus `INITIAL_AGENT_MODE=agent` and explicit `CODEX_PATH` / API-key pass-through |

Mark `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` as a sensitive secret in whichever host runs the Python service. The certificate value never appears in `web/`.

## Token Issuance

- `server.py` `get_config` calls `generate_convo_ai_token(GenerateConvoAITokenOptions(..., token_expire=3600))`.
- The same token grants RTC and RTM privileges; missing, zero, and negative UIDs are replaced with a generated UID before minting so RTM can log in with the token subject.
- Sessions also carry `expires_in=3600` in `create_async_session`, so an idle session aligns with token expiry.

## Token Renewal

- The client listens for `token-privilege-will-expire` on the RTC engine.
- It calls `getConfig()` twice (RTC UID + stored UID) and renews each client.
- If renewal fails, the next failure surfaces through `MESSAGE_ERROR` on RTM or RTC disconnect events.

## CORS

`server/src/server.py` uses:

- `allow_origins=["*"]`
- `allow_credentials=True`
- `allow_methods=["*"]`
- `allow_headers=["*"]`

This is suitable for a local-only quickstart. For a public deploy:

1. Restrict `allow_origins` to your deployed client origin(s).
2. Consider whether `allow_credentials: True` is needed; if not, drop it.
3. Front the FastAPI service with a reverse proxy that enforces its own CORS policy if you need defense in depth.

## Authentication

- No bearer-token or API-key middleware on FastAPI routes.
- No auth in the Next.js rewrites; the browser hits the rewrite directly.
- Anyone with the deployed web URL can start an agent session.

If you need real auth, add a FastAPI dependency that validates a header on each route. Update `web/src/services/api.ts` and `verify-api-contracts.ts` to send and assert the header.

## Input Validation

- pydantic `StartAgentRequest` / `StopAgentRequest` validate body shape automatically.
- Cross-field validation lives in `Agent.start` / `Agent.stop` — they raise `ValueError` on bad input, which `_to_http_error` maps to `400`.
- `RuntimeError` is mapped to `500`.

## Secret Handling Rules

- `server/.env.local` is the developer's secret store; do not commit it.
- `server/.env.example` documents shape only — never put real values there.
- `load_dotenv` reads `server/.env.local` then `server/.env` using a path derived from `server/src/server.py`; missing credentials fail startup initialization and leave routes returning `500`.
- Do not log full env. `logger.error("failed: %s", err)` is fine; `logger.error(os.environ)` is not.

## CSP / Security Headers

- No CSP or HSTS headers are set on FastAPI responses today.
- No security headers are configured in `web/next.config.ts`.
- Add them at the reverse-proxy layer if you put one in front of FastAPI.

## Known Limitations

- No rate limiting on `/get_config`, `/startAgent`, `/stopAgent`. A determined client can rapidly issue tokens — bound this upstream if exposed publicly.
- `server/scripts/run_fake_server.py` accepts the same routes with no validation. Do not deploy it.
- The web client does not encrypt or sign the browser → Next → FastAPI path beyond TLS at the host level.

## Local Codex Boundary

- `/local/workspace`, `/local/workspace/browse`, `/local/runtime`, and
  `/validation/admin/*` are registered on the FastAPI app only when
  `server.create_app(enable_local_routes=True)` — i.e. when
  `VOICE_ACP_LOCAL_RUNTIME=1`. Ordinary and public deployments build the default
  app, which mounts only the three stable quickstart routes, so these routes
  return 404 there rather than depending solely on `require_loopback`. This is
  the backend counterpart to the Next `/api/local/*` rewrite opt-in.
- When they are mounted, `/local/*` and `/validation/admin/*` call
  `require_loopback`; they are not public deployment endpoints.
- `require_loopback` checks the socket peer, the `Origin` header, and the `Host`
  header. The socket-peer check blocks other machines, but a local browser is a
  loopback peer, so a malicious web page could otherwise drive these routes as a
  confused deputy. A cross-site caller is rejected by its forbidden `Origin`
  (which page JavaScript cannot forge); the `Host` check closes the
  DNS-rebinding gap for requests that carry no `Origin`. Non-browser callers
  (curl, native, and the Next server-side rewrite) send no `Origin` and pass.
  This does not defend against a malicious local process, which reaches the
  loopback port without a browser.
- Next registers `/api/local/*` only with an explicit local-development opt-in,
  a loopback backend URL, and a non-production process. `AGENT_BACKEND_URL`
  alone never exposes these routes.
- The native macOS picker runs in the backend process, so the browser receives
  only the selected status payload and never direct filesystem-picker access.
- Project Folder gives ACP a resolved working-directory context. It is not a
  filesystem sandbox or access-control boundary; do not rely on it for isolation.
- `CodexAcpClient` does not log ACP JSON-RPC frames, environment values,
  authentication data, raw reasoning, or private protocol identifiers. Callback
  storage retains only safe update-kind summaries and bounded permission prompts.
- Readiness failures return fixed safe messages rather than exception text,
  paths, protocol/auth details, or command/environment values.
- The Task Runtime Permission Broker keeps at most one current-operation
  request, stores only bounded safe fields, and correlates a response to its
  Workspace and Work. Allow and reject responses select only advertised
  `allow_once` and `reject_once` options; otherwise the request is cancelled.
  There is no timeout. Work cancellation or runner shutdown resolves the
  pending request without granting access.
- Work receipts, safe activity, bounded results, and permission decisions are
  persisted in a mode-`0600` SQLite file under a mode-`0700` state directory.
  These exact mode-bit guarantees apply on POSIX hosts, including the supported
  macOS runtime. Windows CI exercises persistence behavior but does not assert
  POSIX permission bits because Windows does not provide those semantics.
  Raw ACP frames, thought content, authentication data, child environments,
  and private protocol identifiers are not stored.
- A targeted Work receipt privately persists its originating Agora Agent ID so
  completion cannot be redirected to a newer session. The new receipt field is
  never exposed through MCP or Work browser projections, activity, or delivery
  logs; the existing `/startAgent` lifecycle contract remains unchanged.
  Completed Work stores a bounded, redacted inline result and fixed fallback;
  its at-most-8-KiB JSON envelope is submitted only to the exact active Agent
  session. The static Managed prompt treats envelope fields as untrusted data,
  not instructions, and forbids reading code, paths, logs, warnings, protocol
  fields, or identifiers aloud. Never log the envelope or SDK error body.
- No lifecycle HTTP Work/permission route is exposed. The dedicated public MCP
  app exposes only four tools, authenticates before reading request bodies,
  enforces Host/Origin/method/content-type policy and a 64 KiB pre-read cap,
  and derives Agent/Workspace authority from a memory-only bearer.
- Capabilities are generation-bound, use separate start/status budgets plus a
  shared cancellation/permission mutation budget, and are revoked before
  Agent or tunnel shutdown. Tool projections omit filesystem paths, internal
  identifiers, raw ACP frames, and unbounded results.
- A valid pending bearer admits only `initialize`,
  `notifications/initialized`, `tools/list`, and `ping` so Agora can complete
  discovery while Agent creation returns. Pending tool calls, unknown methods,
  mixed batches, malformed JSON, GET, and DELETE return `503` and cannot create
  Work. Only exact active Agent binding grants Work authority.
- Reusable credentials are tried before authentication. Only a typed
  authentication-required response may invoke the advertised ChatGPT method and
  one retry. `CODEX_PATH`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are explicit
  advanced child pass-through values; custom ACP uses a JSON argv array. The
  runtime never logs these values or changes the forced agent mode to full access.

## Managed-path evidence boundary

- ngrok maps only the dedicated public ASGI listener, never the lifecycle FastAPI port.
- ngrok remains in the launcher process group so supervisor cleanup also owns
  the public tunnel; tests substitute a fake CLI and never expose a port.
- MCP requests require a per-session, 256-bit runner-issued capability held only in memory.
- Model-provided tool arguments cannot select a session.
- Loopback seed controls verify the socket peer, reject cross-site `Origin`/`Host`
  callers, and do not trust forwarding headers.
- Validation evidence is gitignored because it can contain transcripts; recursive credential redaction is added with the evidence recorder.
- The harness has no runtime provider selector or public LLM callback route.
