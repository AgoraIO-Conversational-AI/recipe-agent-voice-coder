# Recipe Contract

This document restates the reusable `base` quickstart surface this recipe
inherits from `agent-quickstart-python`, and adds the `acp-local` derivative
extension. The base contract below tracks the upstream `base` recipe (currently
`1.0.0`); the derivative surface is versioned independently under this recipe's
own `recipe_version`.

## Recipe Role

- Role: `acp-local` derivative recipe, inheriting the `base` quickstart contract.
- Target audience: developers extending the Python-backed Agora quickstart with a loopback-only local Codex ACP runtime.
- Reuse model: clone, bind project, run, then customize backend agent behavior or browser UI; the local ACP runtime is an opt-in derivative surface.

## Recipe Scope

This base recipe provides a copyable split-process starter with:

- Python FastAPI token generation and managed agent lifecycle.
- Next.js browser UI with RTC audio, RTM events, transcript, metrics, and connection status.
- Rewrite-only `/api/*` browser facade that hides backend placement.
- Managed default STT, LLM, and TTS provider configuration.
- Contract and local smoke verification that do not require live Agora calls.

## Baseline Implementation Guidance

This repository derives from the Python-backed Agora quickstart baseline (`agent-quickstart-python`). Agents should use this repo's source and progressive disclosure docs as the starting point, then customize.

Do not recreate Agora ConvoAI integration from memory. Provider schemas, SDK builder fields, token behavior, and RTM event details can drift. For a new baseline implementation, follow [L1/L2/from_scratch_bootstrap.md](L1/L2/from_scratch_bootstrap.md) while copying verified patterns from this repo.

## Extension Points

| ID | Surface | How to extend | Required follow-up |
| -- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| `api.routes` | `server/src/server.py`, `web/next.config.ts`, `web/src/services/api.ts` | Add FastAPI route, add rewrite, add browser fetch helper. | Extend `web/scripts/verify-api-contracts.ts`; add smoke coverage if the route belongs in local verification. |
| `agent.managed-config` | `server/src/agent.py` | Change `ADA_PROMPT`, `AGENT_GREETING`, `turn_detection`, `OpenAI`, `DeepgramSTT`, `MiniMaxTTS`, `parameters`, or session options. | Run backend compile and local FastAPI smoke checks; document new env vars in `server/.env.example`. |
| `web.conversation-ui` | `web/src/components/*`, `web/src/lib/conversation.ts` | Customize pre-call, transcript, metrics, connection status, microphone, or visualizer UI. | Preserve RTC/RTM lifecycle ownership and transcript UID normalization. |
| `verification.contracts` | `web/scripts/*.ts`, root `package.json` | Add contract checks for new browser/backend boundaries. | Keep checks runnable without live Agora credentials where possible. |

## Invariants

- Browser code calls only `/api/get_config`, `/api/startAgent`, and `/api/stopAgent` for the default recipe flow.
- Next.js owns the browser-facing `/api/*` paths only through rewrites; do not add `web/app/api/**/route.ts` for agent or token logic.
- FastAPI owns token generation, `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`, BYOK provider keys, and agent lifecycle.
- The backend returns one RTC+RTM-capable token from `get_config`; it must be issued for a concrete non-zero UID.
- `LandingPage.tsx` coordinates config fetch, agent start, RTM login, token renewal, and call teardown.
- `ConversationComponent.tsx` owns RTC join, microphone publish, `AgoraVoiceAI` initialization, transcript/state/metrics listeners, and explicit end-call media release.
- Managed-provider defaults stay server-side unless a change intentionally adds a BYOK path.

## Stable Contracts

| Contract | Stable shape |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Required backend env | `AGORA_APP_ID`, `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` |
| Optional backend env | `AGENT_GREETING`, `HOST`, `PORT` |
| Required web deploy env | `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` |
| Optional browser env | `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_UID` |
| `GET /api/get_config` | Query `channel?`, `uid?`; returns `data.app_id`, `data.token`, `data.uid`, `data.channel_name`, `data.agent_uid`. |
| `POST /api/startAgent` | Body `{ channelName, rtcUid, userUid, parameters? }`; returns `data.agent_id`, `data.channel_name`, `data.status`. |
| `POST /api/stopAgent` | Body `{ agentId }`; returns `{ code: 0, msg: "success" }`. |
| Success envelope | `{ "code": 0, "msg": "success", "data": ... }` where route has data. |
| Verification entry points | `bun run verify:web`, `bun run verify:backend`, `bun run verify:web:proxy`, `bun run verify:local:fastapi`, `bun run verify:local`. |

## Derivative Local Codex Extension

The repository's local Codex foundation is intentionally separate from the
base quickstart contract. It adds Next rewrite-only `/api/local/*` routes for
loopback FastAPI `/local/*` endpoints:

| Browser route | Backend route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE /api/local/workspace` | `/local/workspace` | Read, save, or clear one Project Folder Workspace Scope. |
| `POST /api/local/workspace/browse` | `/local/workspace/browse` | Start the backend-owned native macOS picker and return an operation ID. |
| `GET /api/local/workspace/browse/:operationId` | `/local/workspace/browse/{operation_id}` | Poll the picker operation to a terminal state. |
| `GET /api/local/runtime` | `/local/runtime` | Read safe ACP readiness state without starting ACP. |
| `POST /api/local/runtime` | `/local/runtime` | Explicitly activate ACP for a valid saved Workspace. |

`bun run dev:codex` starts the loopback backend and frontend. The browser gate
requires one existing Project Folder before conversation start. That resolved
folder is persisted locally and passed to ACP as session context; it is not a
filesystem sandbox. The Codex profile supports one primary directory with no
additional directories.

Ordinary FastAPI startup does not start ACP. The local flow explicitly activates
`CodexAcpClient`, which starts one child process/session at a time. Its default
is `npx -y @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.1.7` with
`INITIAL_AGENT_MODE=agent`. It tries reusable credentials before using an
advertised ChatGPT method on typed authentication-required and retrying once.
Advanced `CODEX_PATH`/API-key child pass-through and JSON-argv custom commands
do not select full access or log their environment.

The extension exposes exactly four authenticated MCP Work tools to Agora's
Managed Voice LLM. Completed ACP output is cleaned and redacted, stored as full
bounded inline detail, then projected into an at-most-8-KiB
`LOCAL_WORK_COMPLETED` JSON envelope for the exact originating Agent's
`AgentSession.think` call. Listening uses `inject`; thinking and speaking use
intentional `interrupt`. A normal return means input acceptance only. Only a
received HTTP non-2xx rejection may use one fixed APPEND fallback; ambiguous
outcomes are never retried. Failed Work keeps bounded direct speech and
cancelled Work is silent. This does not add Custom LLM, Activity UI, new MCP
tools, frontend Work authority, or cross-session replay.

Both ends gate these routes behind the same `VOICE_ACP_LOCAL_RUNTIME=1` opt-in.
The FastAPI backend mounts `/local/*` and `/validation/admin/*` only through
`server.create_app(enable_local_routes=True)`; the default app for ordinary and
public deployments exposes only the three stable quickstart routes. Next
likewise registers `/api/local/*` only for that non-production local-runtime
opt-in with a loopback backend URL. Normal and public web deployments retain
only the three stable quickstart routes and rewrites.

The extension's fake ACP, local proxy, fake FastAPI, and build checks are
offline-safe. They do not validate real `npx` execution, browser authentication,
native picker behavior, Agora conversation start, or ngrok; those are
live/manual checks.

## Internal / Subject to Change

- Exact visual layout, component composition, Tailwind classes, and asset choices under `web/src/components/`.
- Exact managed-provider model names, VAD timing, voice IDs, and prompt text, as long as they remain documented extension points.
- In-memory `Agent._sessions` implementation details; the stable behavior is start by channel/user and stop by returned `agent_id`.
- Verification implementation internals under `web/scripts/`; the stable surface is the root script names and what they assert.
- `agora-agents` SDK minor-version behavior; this recipe requires
  `agora-agents>=2.6.0,<3` for `AgentSession.think` but does not freeze every
  SDK field within that range.
